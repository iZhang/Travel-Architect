# Travel Architecture 

An easy-to-use app to learn more about pre-modern architecture. Designed for travelers and students abroad who are curious what a particular building's architectural style is.

## About

This app was developed by Ian Zhang, and you can find the code @ https://github.com/iZhang/travel-architecture

## Method of Use

1. Select a photo from your gallery or take a photo using your camera.
2. A computer vision model leverages a neural net to classify features in your photo and presents the top two architectural styles the model discovered while analyzing the building.
3. Click on architect
4. Choose a flat surface with good lighting and place an example building of the four pre-modern architectural styles available. A chalkboard appears above each model to teach you more about what you're seeing.
5. Walk around the model to see the building from different angles and compare it to the building you took a photo of. 

## Data Privacy and Security

This app is entirely self-contained and does not access any public APIs or websites, nor does it collect or share user data. Camera permissions are required to analyze photos, but the app does not store any information whatsoever.
